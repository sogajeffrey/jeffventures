					<h1>Jeff Ventures</h1>
					<p>
						I help busy people and property owners save time and avoid feeling overwhelmed. My services
						focus on travel planning and organizing, as well as property management and remodeling
						project planning.
					</p>

					<h2>What I offer</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Travel planning and organizing</strong> — end-to-end trip planning,
							itinerary building, booking coordination, budgeting, and logistics for leisure
							and small-group travel.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Property management</strong> — tenant communication, maintenance
							coordination, vendor sourcing, and routine property operations to protect your
							investment.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Remodeling project planning</strong> — scope and timeline development,
							budget estimates, contractor selection guidance, and project scheduling to keep
							remodels on track.
						</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>How I work</h2>
					<p>
						I start with a short discovery conversation to understand goals and constraints. Then I deliver a clear plan you can act on (itinerary, property operations checklist, or
						remodel roadmap). Projects can be delivered as one-off plans or as ongoing
						support and coordination.
