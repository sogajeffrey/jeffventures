	<p>
		Jeff Ventures provides practical, reliable support for travel planning and property
		owners. I focus on removing friction so you can enjoy trips and keep properties
		running smoothly without the stress.
	</p>

	<h3>Travel planning & organizing</h3>
	<p>
		From multi-destination itineraries to daily schedules, I build tailored plans that
		include transportation, lodging suggestions, activity sequencing, and cost
		estimates. I also provide packing lists, contact sheets, and emergency plans for
		peace of mind.
	</p>

	<h3>Property management & remodeling project planning</h3>
	<p>
		For property owners, I offer routine operations support (tenant communication,
		vendor coordination, preventive maintenance) plus remodeling planning services:
		scope documents, timeline creation, budget preparation, and contractor
		evaluation guidance.
	</p>

	<h3>How to get started</h3>
	<p>
		Coming soon.
